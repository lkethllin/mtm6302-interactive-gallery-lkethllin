This project is a responsive image gallery showcasing a collection of puppy photos. Each image can be clicked to view a larger, high-definition version with a caption in a popup modal.

Overview
I built this gallery using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:

HTML defines the gallery layout and modal structure.
CSS makes it responsive and centers elements for a clean, simple look.
JavaScript dynamically generates the gallery images and captions, and handles interactions for opening and closing the modal.
JavaScript Functions

In the JavaScript file (script.js), I used the following functions and methods:

for loop: Loops through the images and captions arrays to dynamically create and display each gallery item.
addEventListener: Listens for click events on the gallery images to display the modal and on the modal itself to close it.
getAttribute: Retrieves the HD image source and caption from each clicked image, making it easy to show extra details.
